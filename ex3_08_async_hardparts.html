      <h3>Challenge 8</h3>
      <p>Perform a GET request to the Bandsintown API <a target=”_blank” href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0"> (found here)</a> to search and find all events associated with your favorite artist. For the 'app_id', use the string 'jshp'.</p>
      <p>Then use the returned JSON object to display all the names of the venues hosting the events in a list in the DOM.</p>
      <p>Make sure to use 'https' for JSBIN to allow the request. There is a div with the ID 'ch3' for you to target.</p>
