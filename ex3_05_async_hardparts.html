      <h3>Challenge 5</h3>
      <button id="activate">#1: Activate Other Button</button>
      <button id="color">#2: Change BG Color</button>
      <p>Write a function <code>changeColor</code> that when invoked will first check if the current page background color is "rgb(221, 238, 255)". If it is, it changes the color to "rgb(255, 238, 221)". If it isn't, it sets the color to "rgb(221, 238, 255)".</p>
      <p>Add a click event listener to button #1 above (it has an id of "activate"). On click, the button should log to the console "clicked #1". It should also set up a click event listener on button #2 (id of "color"). That listener should log to console "clicked #2" and then call the <code>changeColor</code> function you just created.</p>
      <p>Clear the console and hit the 'Run with JS' button. Look at what code has run by analyzing the console. Then try to change the background color by clicking button #2. What needs to happen for the button to work?</p>
      <p><b>Answer: </b>It changes the DOM using the build-in interface which use the browser to manipulate the document also
      I needed add events to the buttons to catch'em and implement the required functionality</p>
