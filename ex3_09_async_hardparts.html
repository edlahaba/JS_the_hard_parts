      <h3>Challenge 9</h3>
      <p>Perform a GET request to the Bandsintown API <a target=”_blank” href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0"> (found here)</a> to search and find all events associated with your favorite artist. For the 'app_id', use the string 'jshp'.</p>
      <p>This time, use the returned JSON object to select ONLY the events that will happen within the United States, and render them to the DOM.</p>
      <p>Make sure to use 'https' for JSBIN to allow the request. There is a div with the ID 'ch4' for you to target.</p>
